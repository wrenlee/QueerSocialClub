# QueerSocialClub

## Project Outline
The Queer Social Club is a capstone-level project for the completion of the BA in Creative Computation. The project combines research, design, and website development and is broken into three phases that correspond with the research, design, and development processes. The end product is a working website that aids in the cultivation of an LGBTQ community on college campuses.
Wren Lee will be the lead researcher, designer, and developer of this project. 
The client is Campus Pride, a non-profit creating safe spaces for LGBTQ college students. The direct contact is Director Shane Windmeyer.

## Specs
Wren used Google Forms and Zoom to conduct qualitative research with LGBTQ students at a variety of college campuses. They also used Notion to conduct the competitive analysis.

During the design phase, Wren used pen and paper to sketch the look and function of the website and used Figma to create a low-fidelity wireframe.

In the development phase, Wren used Webflow, HTML, and CSS to create the look and main functionality of the website. They designed the website with 3 main breakpoints: laptop (1164 px wide), tablet (768 px wide), and mobile vertical (320 px wide). The forum is embedded HTML code from Website Toolbox. The events calendar is an embed code from Google Calendars. Wren used Zapier to connect the event submission Google Form to the Google Calendar.
They sourced the resources from SMU's Women and LGBT Center's website (https://www.smu.edu/studentaffairs/womenandlgbtcenter).
They created the graphics in Canva.
